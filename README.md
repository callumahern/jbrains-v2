# Stage 1: Test-First Programming

- Your bottleneck is bugs (defects, behaviour mistakes)
- Only One Rule: always start with a failing test
- Reduce the cost of defects by reducing the time to discover them
- You don't need to change anything else about your practice
- Certain pressures will probably influence you...gradually.

# Stage 2: Test-Driven Development

- Your bottleneck is the design
- One More Technique: Refactoring
- Reduce the cost of changing the design as needs change
- Avoid throwing large sections away to rewrite them
- Avoid feeling imprisoned by past design decisions

# Stage 3: Predictability

- Your bottleneck is volatility, especially in design
- New Focus: tiny steps | New Principle: YAGNI
- Relentless pursuit of simplicity
- Avoid big refactoring tasks by refactoring continuosly
- Releae features sooner by doing just enough design

# Stage 4: Virtosity

- Your bottleneck is the changing context (or it's elsewhere)
- Different strategies for different situations
- Evolutionary Design Without* Tests
- More judicious use of scares resources
- Trust yourself to add tests when you need them
